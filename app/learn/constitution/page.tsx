          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">The 1999 Constitution</h2>
          <p className="mb-4">
            The 1999 Constitution was promulgated by the military government of General Abdulsalami Abubakar and came into effect on May 29, 1999, marking Nigeria's return to democratic rule. It draws heavily from the 1979 Constitution and was designed to establish a federal republic with powers shared between the federal, state, and local governments.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            The constitution has undergone several amendments (in 2010, 2011, and most recently in 2023) to address various issues and improve governance.
