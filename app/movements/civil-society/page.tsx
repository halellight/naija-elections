          <p className="mb-4">
            Civil Society Organizations (CSOs) in Nigeria encompass a diverse range of non-governmental, non-profit
            entities that operate between the state and the market. They include professional associations, faith-based
            organizations, community groups, trade unions, and advocacy organizations. These groups play crucial roles
            in promoting democracy, human rights, good governance, and social development in Nigeria.

          <p className="mb-4">
            The evolution of civil society in Nigeria can be traced through several distinct phases:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 space-y-2">
            <li>
              <strong>Colonial Era:</strong> Early civil associations formed around ethnic, religious, and professional
              identities, with many eventually contributing to the independence movement.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Post-Independence (1960s-1970s):</strong> Civil society was largely co-opted by the state or
              suppressed during the early years of independence and subsequent military regimes.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Structural Adjustment Period (1980s):</strong> Economic hardship under structural adjustment
              programs led to the emergence of more autonomous civil society groups challenging government policies.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Pro-Democracy Era (1990s):</strong> Civil society organizations played a pivotal role in the
              struggle against military dictatorship, forming coalitions like NADECO and Campaign for Democracy.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Fourth Republic (1999-Present):</strong> Expansion and diversification of civil society, with
              organizations focusing on democratic consolidation, human rights, anti-corruption, and sectoral reforms.

          <p className="mb-4">
            Despite their contributions, civil society organizations in Nigeria face several challenges:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 space-y-2">
            <li>
              <strong>Funding Constraints:</strong> Many CSOs struggle with limited and unpredictable funding, often
              relying heavily on international donors.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Regulatory Hurdles:</strong> Proposed legislation like the NGO Regulation Bill has raised concerns
              about potential restrictions on civil society operations.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Security Risks:</strong> CSO activists, particularly those working on sensitive issues like human
              rights and anti-corruption, sometimes face harassment, intimidation, and physical threats.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Capacity Limitations:</strong> Many organizations lack adequate technical capacity, institutional
              systems, and human resources.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Coordination Challenges:</strong> The sector sometimes struggles with fragmentation, duplication
              of efforts, and limited coordination.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Credibility Issues:</strong> Some CSOs face questions about their legitimacy, accountability, and
              connection to the communities they claim to represent.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Urban Concentration:</strong> Many CSOs are concentrated in urban areas, with limited presence in
