    background:
      "The Pro-Democracy Movement in Nigeria emerged during the military dictatorships of the 1980s and 1990s, particularly during the regimes of Ibrahim Babangida (1985-1993) and Sani Abacha (1993-1998). The movement was a response to the authoritarian rule, human rights abuses, and the suppression of democratic aspirations by these military regimes. It gained significant momentum following the annulment of the June 12, 1993 presidential election, which was widely believed to have been won by business tycoon M.K.O. Abiola.",

    legacy:
      "The Pro-Democracy Movement played a crucial role in ending military rule in Nigeria and establishing the current democratic dispensation known as the Fourth Republic. The movement's sacrifices and struggles helped to instill democratic values and a culture of civic engagement in Nigerian society. Many of the activists who were part of the movement later became political leaders, civil servants, and civil society leaders in the Fourth Republic. The movement also highlighted the importance of civil society organizations in promoting democracy and human rights. However, some critics argue that the democratic transition of 1999 did not fully address the structural issues that enabled military rule, and that the Fourth Republic has not fully realized the democratic aspirations of the pro-democracy movement.",
